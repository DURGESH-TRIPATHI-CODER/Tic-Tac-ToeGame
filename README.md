# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

Welcome to the **Tic-Tac-Toe Game**! This project lets you play the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe with enhanced features and a modern look.

## Features

### Functional Features:
- **Custom Usernames**: Players can enter their names before starting.
- **Automatic Reset**: The game resets automatically after a winner is declared.
- **Dynamic Interface**: The game board appears only after entering usernames and clicking "Continue."
- **Winner Notification**: Displays the winner or draw result clearly.

### UI Improvements:
- **Clear Input Section**: Organized fields for entering player names.
- **Improved Buttons**: "Continue" button with an arrow icon for better flow.
- **Hidden Reset Button**: Shown only during gameplay, hidden at other times.
- **Appealing Background**: Eye-catching colors and design.
- **Responsive Design**: Works well on different screen sizes.

## How It Works
1. **Dynamic User Experience**: The game starts with a clean input interface where players enter their usernames.
2. **Game Logic**: As players take turns clicking cells, the script tracks moves, checks for a winner, and displays results.
3. **Auto-Reset Feature**: After a game concludes (win or draw), the board resets automatically, ensuring uninterrupted gameplay.

### Behind the Scenes
- **HTML Structure**: Designed to separate input forms and the game board for seamless transitions.
- **CSS Styling**: Enhanced visuals with a mix of custom colors, responsive layouts, and animations.
- **JavaScript Magic**: Contains the core logic for:
  - Validating user inputs.
  - Detecting game states (win, draw, or ongoing).
  - Dynamically updating the interface.

## My Efforts
Creating this game involved several steps:
- **Planning**: I outlined the gameâ€™s flow and features before coding.
- **HTML Design**: Structuring the page to separate the input form and game interface.
- **CSS Styling**: Experimenting with colors and layouts to make it visually appealing.
- **JavaScript Development**: Writing and testing the logic for gameplay, interface updates, and reset functionality.
- **Debugging**: Identifying and fixing bugs to ensure smooth gameplay.
- **UI Refinements**: Iterating over the design for a better user experience.

## How to Play

1. **Open the Game**: Open the `index.html` file in a browser.
2. **Enter Names**: Type names for Player X and Player O.
3. **Start the Game**: Click the "Continue" button.
4. **Make Your Moves**: Click on a cell to place your symbol (X or O).
5. **Automatic Reset**: The game resets when a winner is declared or if itâ€™s a draw.
